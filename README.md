# Neural_Network_project

This project focuses on the development of a Deep Learning system capable of identifying traffic signs with high accuracy, a critical task for the safety and reliability of Autonomous Vehicles.

Using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), I designed and trained a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
